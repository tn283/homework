     These rocket landings are part of SpaceX's effort to develop fully reusable boosters — a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said should spur spaceflight by dramatically reducing its cost. Therefore, the re-flight of the CRS-8 first stage will be a very big deal for the company, whenever it occurs.

Musk shares an enthusiasm for reusability with fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, who runs the private spaceflight company Blue Origin (as well as Amazon.com). Indeed, Blue Origin launched and landed the same New Shepard rocket five times during test missions that took place between November 2015 and October 2016. All of these flights were suborbital, however; SpaceX's landings have occurred during launches to Earth orbit.

      SpaceX routinely performs static fire tests at the Texas facility before rockets are shipped to one of the launch sites the company uses: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. (SES-10 will lift off from KSC.)

SpaceX has landed a total of seven Falcon 9 first stages, with the first such success coming in December 2015 during the launch of 11 satellites from Cape Canaveral for the company Orbcomm.

The CRS-8 mission marked SpaceX's second successful touchdown and recovery. There have been five more since then; the latest occurred Jan. 14 of this year, when a Falcon 9 first stage landed on a robotic SpaceX ship at sea after launching 10 satellites for the communications company Iridium. (Five of the seven landings, including the CRS-8 mission's touchdown, have occurred on such "drone ships." During the other two, the rocket stage came back to the launchpad on terra firma.)

      oday, satellite communications company Iridium announced it was going to carpool (or rocket-pool, in this case) with NASA to get five of its NEXT satellites into space on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in early 2018.

The five NEXT satellites will go alongside two NASA satellites. Iridium has been contracting flights on SpaceX’s rockets for a while (this will be its eighth), as has NASA. But it’s the first time the two entities have shared a rocket. NASA’s satellites are part of its GRACE-FO mission, which monitors the constantly shifting gravitational field around the Earth. The Iridium satellites are part of the NEXT program, which initially signed on with SpaceX to put a network of 70 communication satellites in a low-earth orbit. The additional launch will up that number to 75.

        “This is a very smart way to get additional Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit,” said Matt Desch, chief executive officer at Iridium said in a press release. “This launch provides added resiliency to our network for not much more than we had planned originally to launch 72 satellites, including two with Kosmotras.”

Sharing space with NASA’s two GRACE-FO satellites makes sense both from an efficiency and a financial standpoint.

As Desch said, Iridium was going to contract with Kosmotras, a Russian rocket company, to get two more NEXT satellites into the sky, but found a way to launch them from U.S. soil at California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base.

As more and more companies enter the private aerospace market, getting things to and from orbit becomes a much more flexible market (see: Boeing scalping off some ISS tickets). In the long run, this is probably a good thing, because rockets tend to blow up every now and then.
